          Jeremy Cleland Bio
        </h2>
        <p class="bio-text">
          My name is Jeremy Cleland, and I am just starting at Code Fellows. I served 14 years in the Army as a Combat
          Medic and Special Forces Medical Sergeant, but I was medically discharged this summer and now reside in
          Michigan. As my
          medical retirement began in 2020, I was prompted to consider my following professional path and leaned toward
          software development.I have taken programming language classes (Swift, Python, and React.js) on Udemy,
          LinkedIn
          Learning, and Coursera during the previous three years. I have decided to pursue JavaScript. My current
          Operating System is macOS Ventura, and I am running Version 13.0.1. While I have taken several courses, I am
          eager to start from scratch, learn everything I missed the first time, and become a more prosperous and
          efficient developer.
